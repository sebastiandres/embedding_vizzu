# Embedding Vizzu

## Why?

Vizzu is a visualization tool with Javascript and Python libraries.
It also has a [no-code platform](https://www.vizzu.io/) where you can edit your visualizations online.
You can obtain a public link to share your visualizations with other people, and you can use this public link to embed your animated visualizations on different presenting softwares.

## Where?
Different options to embed vizzu on your presentation
* [HTML](https://sebastiandres.github.io/embedding_vizzu/html/)
* Jupyter Notebook
* PowerPoint
* RevealJS
* Quarto

## Observation
On the cases where an iframe is used, make sure to include ´allow="fullscreen"´ so you can present fullscreen (Thanks Peter!).

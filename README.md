# Embedding Vizzu

## Why?

Vizzu is a visualization tool with Javascript and Python libraries.
It also has a no-code platform where you can edit your visualizations online.
You can obtain a public link to share your visualizations with other people, and you can use this public link to embed your animated visualizations on different presenting softwares.

## Observation
On the cases where an iframe is used, make sure to include ´allow="fullscreen"´ so you can present fullscreen (Thanks Peter!).
